Writes the given list of strings to the `.fakeletters` file
Each word must consist of only letters, and will be written
to be all lowercase and space-separated
(Note, you can use the previous two functions to help test this one!)
Requires that `filename` ends with `.fakeletters`
Example:
write_fake("output.fakeletters", ["test", "out"])
contains("output.fakeletters", "test") -> True
contains("output.fakeletters", "other") -> False
count_words("output.fakeletters") -> 2
