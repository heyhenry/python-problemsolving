Things to do next session: 

- redact the usage of a temp_coords
- create validation checks for player move input (so that if its more than 2 digits it is considered invalid, or restrict input ability to 2 digits(?))
- maybe create a separate function to validate string char versus digit char prior to valid_move check function for int continuity for row,col assessment
- add additional details once someone has won 
- potentially, but temporarily add the win checks for knots (o) as well x
- completely redact the method checking for a win with a more dynamic solution x
